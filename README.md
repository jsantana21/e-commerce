# E-Commerce Website Project

### Project Duration: December 16, 2020 - January 20, 2021 
### Project Task
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim of this project is to create an e-Commerce site using NextJS (React) in the frontend and Commerce.js as a third party API for the backend include features such as product list and details, shopping cart and checking out, and payment using Stripe.


### Background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an effort to apply what I know of the React webframe work, I decided to create a simple e-commerce site of electronic products to demonstrate understanding of how to use big data and heavy backend use in context of commercial transactions online. Normally I would've used Node Express and MongoDB for the backend but to change things up in this project I decided to use a third party API called Commerce.js which is specfically made for backends to e-commerce sites. I also wanted to create something practical that is similar to something I would probably work on in the workplace thus making a nice addition to my resume as an impressive project. It should be noted this e-commerce site project will be kept relatively simple as e-commerce is fairly new to me right now so this project might be updated in the future beyond January 2021. It should also be noted this is the *third* attempt at completing this project as the previous two attempts done in December were unsuccessful and thus the repos were privated or deleted.
