# E-Commerce Web Store Project

### Project Duration: January 10, 2021 - February 2021 (Expected Date of Completion)

### Project Task
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim of this project is to create an e-Commerce site using React and Javascript in the frontend and Commerce.js as a third party API for the backend include features such as product list and details, shopping cart and checking out, and payment using Stripe.


### Background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an effort to apply what I know of the React webframe work, I decided to create a simple e-commerce site of electronic products to demonstrate understanding of how to use big data and heavy backend use in context of commercial transactions online. Normally I would've used Node Express and MongoDB for the backend but to change things up in this project I decided to use a third party API called Commerce.js which is specfically made for backends to e-commerce sites. I also wanted to create something practical that is similar to something I would probably work on in the workplace thus making a nice addition to my resume as an impressive project. It should be noted this e-commerce site project will be kept relatively simple as e-commerce is fairly new to me right now and thus this project is subject to change with new updates in the future beyond February 2021.
